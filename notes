# 📘 **Short Notes....
1. NLP means teaching computers to understand text.
2. First step is **collecting a paragraph** (your `Paragraph` variable).
3. Then we **split the paragraph into sentences** using:

   * `nltk.sent_tokenize()` → Sentence Tokenization
4. Next, each sentence is broken into **words** using Tokenization.
5. Before training a model, text must be cleaned.
6. You used **Regex (`re.sub`)** to remove unwanted characters:

   * Removed numbers
   * Removed punctuation
   * Kept only letters (a–z, A–Z)
7. Converted all text to lowercase.
8. Split the cleaned text into individual words.
9. Removed **stopwords** like “is”, “the”, “and” using:

   * `stopwords.words('english')`
10. Performed **Stemming** using PorterStemmer:

* Converted words to their root form
* Example: *running → run*, *studies → studi*

11. Built a **corpus**, which is a list of all cleaned sentences.
12. Used **CountVectorizer** to convert text into numbers (Bag of Words).
13. `cv.fit_transform(corpus)` creates a matrix of word counts.
14. This matrix is stored in **X**.
15. Labels (spam/not spam) are stored in **y** (in your later code).
16. Used `train_test_split()` to divide data:

* **X_train** → Text used for training
* **X_test** → Text used for testing
* **y_train** → Correct labels for training data
* **y_test** → Correct labels for test data

17. Then created a spam detection model using:

* `MultinomialNB()`

18. Trained the model using:

* `.fit(X_train, y_train)`

19. Made predictions on unseen data with:

* `.predict(X_test)`

20. Compared predictions with real answers using accuracy score.
21. Printed the model’s accuracy (e.g., 0.90 = 90%).
22. This shows how well your model can detect spam.
23. The full pipeline:

    * Cleaning → Tokenizing → Stemming → Stopwords → Vectorizing → Splitting → Training → Testing.
24. These preprocessing steps improve model accuracy.
25. Without them, raw text would be noisy and hard for ML models to understand.
